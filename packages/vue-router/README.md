# @ionic/vue-router

Routing integration for `@ionic/vue` applications.

## Building

1. Install dependencies from the root of the repo:

```shell
npm install
```

3. Build `@ionic/vue-router`:

- Either by running it from the root with `npm run build -w packages/vue-router`
- Or by changing directory into `packages/vue-router` and then running its build:

```shell
cd packages/vue-router
npm run build
```

## Tests

- Tests are found in the `__tests__` directory and use Jest.
- Tests can be run using `npm run test.spec` (additionally include `-w packages/vue-router` if running the command from the root of the repo)
- Bug fix and feature PRs should have new tests verifying the PR functionality.
